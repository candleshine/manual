# Structure of the CLI output

## files created by the CLI

### package.json

Every app needs a package.json. The CLI pre-populates this with the dependencies Sakura API is expecting.

### tslint.json, tsconfig.json, tsconfig.spec.json

These three files are _typescript_ configuration files.  
They will set the standard lint and compiler configurations for your project.  
The CLI produces a recommended set of settings, but you are welcome to make changes.  
For more about these files, read \([https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html)\) \([https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/tslint-json/](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/tslint-json/)\)

### /docker/local-test.yml

This file is the YML configuration file used by docker compose to build a test container for your project.  
As a minimum, this build puts a blank mongoDB instance for your API to use. We use a blank one in our test environment when developing so that old data does not create artifacts that will corrupt the test.

This file is used by the script found in _**scripts/docker:local-compose-up.sh**_.

This file is also used to shut down a container when a `docker-compose down` command is executed. More commonly this is run from the command `npm run docker:local-compose-down`

### /scripts/build.sh

This file is run when the command `npm run build` is executed. At its core, it compiles the typescript code into the `/dist/` folder ready to be packaged into a docker container.

### /scripts/docker:local-compose-up.sh

This file is run when the command `npm run docker:local-compose-up`. Defunct containers are pruned from the system and a new container based on the _**local-test.yml**_ file is run. This will be active until `npm run docker:local-compose-down` is run.

### /scripts/install.sh

This is a placeholder for later.

### /scripts/nodemon.sh and /scripts/start.sh

These files are run when the command `npm start` is executed. A container is created with a new _**/dist/**_ directory.  
The node server from the _**/dist/**_ directory starts and listens on the specified port \(defaults to 8001\).

### /scripts/test.sh

This file is run when the command `npm run test` is executed. A container is created with a test environment running. That means the build directory for this environment is based on the _**tsconfig.spec.json**_ file instead of the _**tsconfig.json**_.  
The Jasmine tests are run. When the tests are completed, the container is shut down.

### /scripts/test:db.sh

This file is run when the command `npm run test:db` is executed.  
This is the same as the _**test.sh**_ script except for two notable differences. First, the container is not closed at the end of the Jasmine run. Second, the build is based on the _**tsconfig.json**_ file instead of the _**tsconfig.spec.json**_

### /src

This directory will be where the bulk of the source code for your new Sakura API project will live. A more in depth description of where pieces go can be found below.

A few notes about what the CLI scaffolds for you.

#### /src/api/config.api.ts

This is a default **api** created to show status. If you run `npm start`, you can navigate to [http://localhost:8001/api](http://localhost:8001/api) and see

```text
{
server: "example-api",
serverUp: true
}
```

where _**example-api**_ is the name of the project you are scaffolding.

A close examination of this file will show that, all request methods, **PUT**, **POST**, **GET**, **DELETE**, etc, are handled with the same handler. Different behavior, based on the method, will require their own handlers.

### /spec
